# serverless

This cloud function, named DataProcessor, is a lightweight, serverless computing solution designed to perform real-time data analysis. Hosted on a cloud platform, it gets triggered automatically in response to specific events, such as incoming data streams from web APIs. The function processes the data by applying predefined algorithms and then stores the results in a cloud database. DataProcessor is scalable, ensuring high performance during varying data loads, and only consumes resources when active, offering a cost-effective solution for on-demand data processing tasks.
